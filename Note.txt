SAMl Authentication:
    What is SAML Authentication:

    SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language 

    SAML is an XML based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, 
    in particular, between an identity provider(IDP) and a servicers provider(SP). 
    Single sign-on (SSO) functionality is frequently implemented using it.

    Why SAML 
        In order to enable smooth and consistent authentication across different platoforms(salesforce, jera, MS)
        SAML exchanges assertion that contian user identity information - uses Single sign-on (SSO)  

    -> Uses salesforce 


windows vs SAML
        While both Windows Authentication and SAML serve the purpose of authentication, 
        they operate in different contexts and may be used in different types of environments.
        Windows Authentication is specific to Windows-based systems and Active Directory, 
        while SAML is a more generalized standard that can be implemented across various platforms and technologies.


        its uses XML based protocol 

OPENID :
    --> OPENID uses single set of credentials to access mutliple applications or websites without need of sperate username and password

    -->uses GOOGLE 

     --> its uses HTTP (HyperText transfer protocol) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) 


Kerberos :
    --> After logging into their Windows computer, a user can access a variety of intranet services, 
        including file shares and internal apps, by using Kerberos without having to enter their login information again.
    --> uses secret-key cryptography     
    --> Kerberos use in windoes authentication from 2000 
    --> its support SSO single sign-on 



OAUTH 2.0 Authentication:
    --> is way of two websites talk each other without sharing your password  

    --> its based on Access tokens 

    --> example: login to github ==>

    --> i used button login from google in github website, it will redirect to goole account and i will login, then 
    will create access token redirect to github with access token. github will store my access token for while 
    then we can acess the github sever. 

    --> its uses HTTP (HyperText transfer protocol) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
